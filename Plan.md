# Setup

1. Make dimBridge work.
2. Make a new observable notebook that uses simplified dimBridge.
3. Create a new directory for the implementation.

# Implementation

1. Investigate what is needed from the dimBridge for implementation.
2. Investigate how we could visualize the predicates (point color or lines).
3. See if we could do it directly in the observable notebook.
4. If not, create new code in the project here.

# What we want to achieve

1. You can clearly select predicates and see their boundaries in the projection view.
2. You can go step by step through the gradient descent and see how the predicates change.
3. You can select a multiple predicates and see how they interact with each other.
